"""scripts/build_standing_set.py — Phase 0 standing-tier scorer (v3).

Embedding-based exemplar-projection scoring for the salience-tier
standing set. Uses mnemon's existing FastEmbed infrastructure
(bge-small-en-v1.5, 384d, ONNX). NO external LLM, NO new dependency.

This is the SOTA pattern for few-shot text classification with
hand-defined class prototypes — anchor texts as positive/negative
exemplars, project candidates against them, score by max cosine.
See: SetFit, prototype networks, anchor-based reranking.

LLM-judge would be a more accurate alternative but is queued as a
future opt-in (private/ROADMAP.md) to keep mnemon's public-release
onboarding dependency-free.

Plan: private/mnemon-salience-tier-plan-260521.md

Scoring (all signals in [0, 1] before weighting):

    constraint_score   max cosine(memory, constraint_exemplars)
                       "does this look like a standing rule?"
    time_penalty       max cosine(memory, time_bounded_exemplars)
                       "is this a time-bounded status update?"
    correction         1.0 if content_type='feedback' AND confidence
                       ≥ 0.85 AND title/content matches correction
                       pattern. Behavioral signal — operator-corrected
                       memories are explicit standing-tier material.
    contradiction      normalized count of incoming relations where
                       memory is winning side of 'contradicts' or
                       'supersedes'. Behavioral signal — memories
                       that displace others on load-bearing facts.
    breadth            normalized count of distinct content_types
                       in top-50 FTS neighbors. Cross-domain proxy.

    combined = 2.0·constraint + 2.0·correction + 1.0·contradiction
             + 0.5·breadth − 1.5·time_penalty

Weights are operator-tunable at the top of this file. Default
auto-selects top-10 (capped at hard ceiling 20 per the plan's
"cap is the contract" invariant). Operator can override via the
companion `scripts/salience_phase0.sh select <IDS>` subcommand.

Outputs (two files, both consumed by the recall hook):

    ~/.mnemon/standing.json          {"ids": [...]}
    ~/.mnemon/standing-rendered.md   pre-fetched rendered content,
                                     so the recall hook reads from
                                     disk (microseconds) instead of
                                     per-prompt HTTP fetch (~5s for
                                     N=10)

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/build_standing_set.py --db /path/to/snapshot.sqlite
    .venv/bin/python scripts/build_standing_set.py --top 10  # default
