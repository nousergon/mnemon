"""Remote-proxy MCP server (stdio transport).

When a remote vault is configured (``MNEMON_REMOTE_URL`` env var or
``~/.mnemon/remote_url`` file), ``mnemon serve`` runs THIS server instead
of the local-SQLite :func:`mnemon.server.run_stdio`. Every tool call is
forwarded to the remote vault via
:func:`mnemon.hooks._remote_client.call_tool_sync` — the local SQLite
vault is never opened.

Why this exists
---------------
Before 2026-06-04, ``mnemon serve`` always opened the local vault even
when a remote was configured, so a machine pointed at a cloud vault
exposed TWO connected MCP servers backed by DIFFERENT data — the local
one a stale, near-empty vault. Reads/writes through it silently diverged
from the source of truth (a stale ``memory_status``/``memory_timeline``
answered as if authoritative). The CLI read/write commands already
routed to the remote via ``cli._remote_mode_active()``; ``serve`` was the
one command that didn't. This module closes that gap: in remote mode the
local vault is structurally inaccessible over MCP.

Design — no drift
-----------------
The proxy mirrors the EXACT tool surface of :mod:`mnemon.server` by
wrapping each registered tool function with :func:`functools.wraps`
(which copies name, docstring, signature, and annotations → an identical
MCP input schema) and swapping the body to forward remotely. The tool
set is enumerated from the local server's own tool manager, so adding a
tool to ``server.py`` automatically adds its proxy. ``tests/
test_server_proxy.py`` asserts schema + description parity as a
belt-and-suspenders guard.

Fail-loud
---------
A remote / network / auth / config failure propagates out of the tool
call (surfaced to the MCP client as a tool error) rather than degrading
to the local vault. Per the project no-silent-fails rule, the proxy must
never silently answer from the wrong store.
