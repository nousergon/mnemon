"""Persistent MCP Streamable HTTP session storage.

When a Fly.io machine running mnemon auto-stops on idle, the in-memory
session dict in ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager._server_instances`` is
lost. After the machine wakes, any client request bearing a previously-
issued ``Mcp-Session-Id`` header gets a 404 (per the MCP spec — but the
spec also says clients SHOULD reinit on 404, which Claude Code's MCP
client does not reliably do, so the symptom is "MCP UI says connected
but every tool call fails").

This module sidesteps that by persisting issued session IDs to SQLite,
so a known-but-not-in-memory session can be transparently resumed on
the new process. The resumed session is born with ``stateless=True``,
which makes the underlying ``ServerSession`` skip the init handshake
and accept tool calls immediately. mnemon does not use any client-
capability-gated features (sampling, elicitation, roots), so the
absence of negotiated client capabilities on a resumed session is a
no-op for our toolset.

The complement on the client side is the ``/health`` warm-keeper hook
installed by ``mnemon setup`` (see ``setup.py:_hooks_config``). The
hook keeps Fly warm during active sessions; this module catches the
edge case where the machine *did* cold-stop anyway (long idle, manual
stop, deploy).

        full ``handle_request`` await, which made the lock a single
        point of failure: on 2026-05-06 a wedged fresh-init handler
        held the lock and every subsequent fresh-init request queued
        behind it and timed out at the client side, while in-memory
        hits and resumes (which don't need the lock) kept working.
        Releasing earlier means one wedged handler can't take down the
        server's ability to accept new sessions.
